This part i made a wait function to eliminate the task for a certain time (ticks)
then activate it again and made a lab to run task 1,2,3 with different waiting times
and same priority and run task 4 with highest priority with longest wait time
" Task 1 activates Task 4 after 30 count " i alse updated idle task to go to 
sleep mode ( wfe ) to minimize using the processor while no tasks is running
