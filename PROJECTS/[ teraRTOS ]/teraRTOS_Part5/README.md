This part i implemented two cases in 2 labs

First lab --> is about priority inversion delay which happens when higher priority task
request mutex which is acquired by lower priority task

Second lab --> is about deadlock which happens when first task acquire mutex 1 and second task
acquire mutex 2 then first task request mutex 2 and second task request mutex 1
