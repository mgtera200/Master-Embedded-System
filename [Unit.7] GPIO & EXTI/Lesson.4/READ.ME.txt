This project i made driver for EXTI module and used it to 
configure Port B pin number 9 as an external interrupt pin
then we configured it as an falling edge interrupt and used the 
irq handler to call the call back function which writes string on lCD
then deinitialize the interrupt pin again :)))))


ALL SHOWN IN SIMULATION VIDEO!
