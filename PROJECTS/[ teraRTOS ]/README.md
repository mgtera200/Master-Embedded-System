# Description

- This project showcases the meticulous development of a real-time operating system (RTOS) optimized for the ARM Cortex-M3 architecture. Tailored for execution on the STM32F103C6T6 development board, with meticulous simulation using STM32Cube IDE, the project unfolds across **five structured parts**.

- Each part of this project contributes significant enhancements and insights, facilitating a systematic evolution of the RTOS. Through structured exploration and experimentation, this project offers invaluable learning opportunities for enthusiasts and professionals aspiring to delve into RTOS development for embedded systems.

# Features

- Task Context Switch/Restore
- Tasks Queue/Buffers
- Scheduling Algorithm 
	- Preemptive based on priority
	- Round-robin for tasks which have the same priority
- Wait function to eliminate the task for a certain time (ticks)
- Mutual Exclusion ( Mutex )
