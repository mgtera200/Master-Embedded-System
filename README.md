# Welcome to My Embedded Systems Repository!

<p align="center">It's a pleasure to have you here.</p>

## Description

This repository houses drivers, projects, and labs meticulously crafted during my pursuit of the Learn-In-Depth diploma. The Learn-In-Depth diploma program is dedicated to the mastery of embedded systems from foundational principles, offering a comprehensive curriculum and practical exercises designed to foster deep understanding and expertise.

For further details regarding the Learn-In-Depth diploma program, please visit [Learn-In-Depth website](https://www.learn-in-depth-store.com/).

## Folder Structure

### DRIVERS [ATmega32]
This folder contains drivers specifically developed for the ATmega32 microcontroller. These drivers provide the necessary abstraction layers for interfacing with various peripherals and components, facilitating rapid development of embedded applications.

### DRIVERS [STM32F103C6]
Similarly, this folder contains drivers tailored for the STM32F103C6 microcontroller. These drivers adhere to the specific hardware characteristics and features of the STM32F103C6, enabling seamless integration with the microcontroller peripherals.

### LABS [STM32F103C6 - ATmega32]
In the LABS directory, you'll find a collection of hands-on laboratory exercises conducted using both the STM32F103C6 and ATmega32 microcontrollers. These labs are designed to reinforce theoretical concepts and provide practical experience in embedded systems development.

### PROJECTS
The PROJECTS directory houses complete embedded systems projects developed as part of the Learn-In-Depth diploma program. These projects demonstrate the application of embedded systems principles in real-world scenarios and showcase the capabilities of the microcontrollers.

## Getting Started
To explore the contents of each folder and dive into the embedded systems projects and exercises, simply navigate through the respective directories. Feel free to clone or download the repository to your local machine for further exploration and experimentation.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
