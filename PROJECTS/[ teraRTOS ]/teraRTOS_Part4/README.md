- This part i implemented a wait function to eliminate the task for a certain time (ticks) then activate it again.

- I made a **lab** to run task 1,2,3 with different waiting times and same priority and run task 4 with highest priority with longest wait time ( Task 1 activates Task 4 after 30 count ).

- I also updated idle task to go to sleep mode ( wfe ) to minimize using the processor while no tasks is running.
